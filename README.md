# ISU-Work-Log

a) 

b) The purpose of this product 

c) At the very least by the middle of June I want to have a completed, if not rudamentary, pixel-art RPG game with basic combat, healing, and map mechanics with at least 1-2 bosses.

d) I will use repl.it and pygame in order to code, check, and run my game.
