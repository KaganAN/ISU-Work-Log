# ISU-Work-Log

a) Cursed World. I decided to find an interesting (or any name, really) first and then work backwards for character backstory, setting, etc.

b) The purpose of this product is to be a playable and fun experience for the user with all of the basic mechanics one comes to expect when playing an rpg type of game. My purpose for creating it is in order to learn pygame as well as get a project under my belt and understand more about the game development proccess.  

c) At the very least by the middle of June I want to have a completed, if not rudamentary, pixel-art RPG game with basic combat, healing, and map mechanics with at least 1-2 bosses.

d) I will use repl.it and pygame in order to code, check, and run my game.
